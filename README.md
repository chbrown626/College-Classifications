# Classifying Colleges Creatively

### Overview

This project takes HTML website data from four colleges in the United States and classifies them into seven different categories using Python's SciKit Learn and NLTK. The [4 Universities](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/theo-20/www/data/) project was originally completed using [*Rainbow*](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/theo-11/www/naive-bayes/gentle_intro.html) in 1998, but has not been attempted using new coding or data science methods.
